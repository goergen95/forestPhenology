abstract = {During recent years unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been increasingly used for research and application in both agriculture and forestry. Nevertheless, most of this work has been devoted to improving accuracy and explanatory power, often at the cost of usability and affordability. We tested a low-cost UAV and a simple workflow to apply four different greenness indices to the monitoring of pine (Pinus sylvestris and P. nigra) post-fire regeneration in a Mediterranean forest. We selected two sites and measured all pines within a pre-selected plot. Winter flights were carried out at each of the sites, at two flight heights (50 and 120 m). Automatically normalized images entered an structure from motion (SfM) based photogrammetric software for restitution, and the obtained point cloud and orthomosaic processed to get a canopy height model and four different greenness indices. The sum of pine diameter at breast height (DBH) was regressed on summary statistics of greenness indices and the canopy height model. Excess green index (ExGI) and green chromatic coordinate (GCC) index outperformed the visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) and green red vegetation index (GRVI) in estimating pine DBH, while canopy height slightly improved the models. Flight height did not severely affect model performance. Our results show that low cost UAVs may improve forest monitoring after disturbance, even in those habitats and situations where resource limitation is an issue.},

abstract = {Within the MARS Crop Yield Forecasting System (MCYFS; Royer and Genovese, 2004) of the European Commission vegetation indicators like NDVI, SAVI and fAPAR are operationally derived for daily, decadal and monthly time steps. Besides low resolution sensors as SPOT-VGT and NOAA-AVHRR, medium resolution data from TERRA/AQUA-MODIS or ENVISAT-MERIS are used at pan-European level. In case of available time series, esp. NOAA-AVHRR (since 1981) and SPOT-VGT (since 1998) difference values of the indicators (e.g. relative or absolute differences) and frequency analysis of the indicators (e.g. position in historical range or distribution) are calculated. The exploitation of the data is performed at full resolution, at grid level of the MCYFS or regional unmixed means (C-indicators) are used. Therefore a database has been set-up in order to provide the indicators based on a weighted average for each CORINE land cover class within an area of interest. The current work aims to develop a strategy for an optimal use of the different sensors and thus derived indicators at different aggregation levels for the ingestion into the MCYFS. As a first step smoothing algorithms have to be applied to the time series to diminish noise effects. Therefore, existing methods as simple sliding windows, piecewise linear regression or fitting of polynomial functions are employed and compared. Thereafter, the time series analysis is performed with the aim to establish relationships between indicators profile features and the crop phenology},

abstract = {Remote estimation of flower number in oilseed rape under different nitrogen (N) treatments is imperative in precision agriculture and field remote sensing, which can help to predict the yield of oilseed rape. In this study, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with Red Green Blue (RGB) and multispectral cameras was used to acquire a series of field images at the flowering stage, and the flower number was manually counted as a reference. Images of the rape field were first classified using K-means method based on Commission Internationale de l'{\'{E}}clairage (CIE) L*a*b* space, and the result showed that classified flower coverage area (FCA) possessed a high correlation with the flower number (r2 = 0.89). The relationships between ten commonly used vegetation indices (VIs) extracted from UAV-based RGB and multispectral images and the flower number were investigated, and the VIs of Normalized Green Red Difference Index (NGRDI), Red Green Ratio Index (RGRI) and Modified Green Red Vegetation Index (MGRVI) exhibited the highest correlation to the flower number with the absolute correlation coefficient (r) of 0.91. Random forest (RF) model was developed to predict the flower number, and a good performance was achieved with all UAV variables (r2 = 0.93 and RMSEP = 16.18), while the optimal subset regression (OSR) model was further proposed to simplify the RF model, and a better result with r2 = 0.95 and RMSEP = 14.13 was obtained with the variable combination of RGRI, normalized difference spectral index (NDSI (944, 758)) and FCA. Our findings suggest that combining VIs and image classification from UAV-based RGB and multispectral images possesses the potential of estimating flower number in oilseed rape.},

abstract = {Vegetation phenology such as the onset of green-up and senescence is strongly controlled by climate and other environmental factors, and in turn affects the terrestrial carbon balance. Therefore, phenological observation is important as an indicator of global warming and for estimation of the terrestrial carbon balance. Because phenological responses differ from species to species, precise monitoring from the species scale to the global scale is required. In this study, we analyzed images from digital cameras, which have proliferated in recent years, to investigate their utility as remote sensors. We collected daily images taken by digital cameras in national parks across Japan over 8. years in wetland mixed deciduous forest, and evergreen broadleaved forest. Values of red, green, and blue (RGB) channels in each pixel within images were extracted, and a vegetation green excess index (2G-RBi) was calculated to detect phenology. The time series of 2G-RBi showed clear phenological patterns of each vegetation type in each year at the species or community scale. Even physiological damage due to a typhoon was detected. The dates of green-up were estimated easily and objectively from the second derivative of 2G-RBi, and a trend in yearly green-up dates of various types of vegetation was demonstrated. Furthermore, a strong correlation between interannual variations in green-up dates and local spring temperature was found, and the sensitivity of green-up date to temperature was revealed. The results suggest the utility of digital cameras for phenological observations at precise temporal and spatial resolutions, despite a year-to-year drift of color balance of camera as a technical device. As a form of near-surface remote sensing, digital cameras could obtain significant ecological information. Establishing camera networks could help us understand phenological responses at a wide range of scales. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

UAV flights were carried out over a deciduous woodland during the spring season of 2015, from which a temporal series of 5 cm spatial resolution orthophotos was generated. Initial results are presented in this paper. Four trees with different observed Start of Season (SOS) dates were selected to monitor UAV-derived Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC). The chronological order when sudden increases of GCC values occurred matched with the chronological order of observed SOS. Trees with later observed SOS presented GCC values increasing slowly over time, which were associated with development of understory vegetation. It is concluded that UAV imagery has the potential to track leaf phenology at the individual tree level, but further studies are necessary to better understand this new level of information detected from UAVs.},

Deep learning, a cutting-edge technology evolved from Artificial Intelligence, was seen to outperform other techniques when it comes to complex problems such as image classification. In this work, we present a novel method to classify forest tree species through high resolution RGB images acquired with a simple consumer grade camera mounted on a UAV platform using Residual Neural Networks. We used UAV RGB images acquired over three years that varied in numerous acquisition parameters such as season, time, illumination and angle to train the neural network. To begin with, we have experimented with limited data towards the identification of two pine species namely red pine and white pine from the rest of the species. We performed two experiments, first with the images from all three acquisition years and the second with images from only one acquisition year. In the first experiment, we obtained 80{\%} classification accuracy when the trained network was tested on a distinct set of images and in the second experiment, we obtained 51{\%} classification accuracy. As a part of this work, a novel dataset of high-resolution labelled tree species is generated that can be used to conduct further studies involving deep neural networks in forestry.},

Six noise reduction filters were tested: piecewise-logistic, Savitzky-Golay, cubic smoothing splines, Gaussian models, Fourier series and polynomial curve fitting.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Long-term observations of vegetation phenology can be used to monitor the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. Satellite remote sensing provides the most efficient means to observe phenological events through time series analysis of vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This study investigates the potential of a Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), which has been linked to vegetation light use efficiency, to improve the accuracy of MODIS-based estimates of phenology in an evergreen conifer forest. Timings of the start and end of the growing season (SGS and EGS) were derived from a 13-year-long time series of PRI and NDVI based on a MAIAC (multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction) processed MODIS dataset and standard MODIS NDVI product data. The derived dates were validated with phenology estimates from ground-based flux tower measurements of ecosystem productivity. Significant correlations were found between the MAIAC time series and ground-estimated SGS (R2= 0.36-0.8), which is remarkable since previous studies have found it difficult to observe inter-annual phenological variations in evergreen vegetation from satellite data. The considerably noisier NDVI product could not accurately predict SGS, and EGS could not be derived successfully from any of the time series. While the strongest relationship overall was found between SGS derived from the ground data and PRI, MAIAC NDVI exhibited high correlations with SGS more consistently (R2{\textgreater} 0.6 in all cases). The results suggest that PRI can serve as an effective indicator of spring seasonal transitions, however, additional work is necessary to confirm the relationships observed and to further explore the usefulness of MODIS PRI for detecting phenology.},

@article{Karkauskaite2017a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Satellite remote sensing of plant phenology provides an important indicator of climate change. However, start of the growing season (SOS) estimates in Northern Hemisphere boreal forest areas are known to be challenged by the presence of seasonal snow cover and limited seasonality in the greenness signal for evergreen needleleaf forests, which can both bias and impede trend estimates of SOS. The newly developed Plant Phenology Index (PPI) was specifically designed to overcome both problems. Here we use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (2000-2014) to analyze the ability of PPI for estimating start of season (SOS) in boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, in comparison to two other widely applied indices for SOS retrieval: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Satellite-based SOS is evaluated against gross primary production (GPP)-retrieved SOS derived from a network of flux tower observations in boreal areas (a total of 81 site-years analyzed). Spatiotemporal relationships between SOS derived from PPI, EVI and NDVI are furthermore studied for different boreal land cover types and regions. The overall correlation between SOS derived from VIs and ground measurements was rather low, but PPI performed significantly better (r = 0.50, p {\textless} 0.01) than EVI and NDVI which both showed a very poor correlation (r = 0.11, p = 0. 16 and r = 0.08, p = 0.24). PPI, EVI and NDVI overall produce similar trends in SOS for the Northern Hemisphere showing an advance in SOS towards earlier dates (0.28, 0.23 and 0.26 days/year), but a pronounced difference in trend estimates between PPI and EVI/NDVI is observed for different land cover types. Deciduous needleleaf forest is characterized by the largest advance in SOS when considering all indices, yet PPI showed less dramatic changes as compared to EVI/NDVI (0.47 days/year as compared to 0.62 and 0.74). PPI SOS trends were found to be higher for deciduous broadleaf forests and savannas (0.54 and 0.56 days/year). Taken together, the findings of this study suggest improved performance of PPI over NDVI and EVI in retrieval of SOS in boreal regions and precautions must be taken when interpreting spatio-temporal patterns of SOS from the latter two indices.},

abstract = {Forests are critical habitats for biodiversity and they are also essential for the provision of a wide range of ecosystem services that are important to human well-being. There is increasing evidence that biodiversity contributes to forest ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. Here we provide a review of forest ecosystem services including biomass production, habitat provisioning services, pollination, seed dispersal, resistance to wind storms, fire regulation and mitigation, pest regulation of native and invading insects, carbon sequestration, and cultural ecosystem services, in relation to forest type, structure and diversity. We also consider relationships between forest biodiversity and multifunctionality, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. We compare the concepts of ecosystem processes, functions and services to clarify their definitions. Our review of published studies indicates a lack of empirical studies that establish quantitative and causal relationships between forest biodiversity and many important ecosystem services. The literature is highly skewed; studies on provisioning of nutrition and energy, and on cultural services, delivered by mixed-species forests are under-represented. Planted forests offer ample opportunity for optimising their composition and diversity because replanting after harvesting is a recurring process. Planting mixed-species forests should be given more consideration as they are likely to provide a wider range of ecosystem services within the forest and for adjacent land uses. This review also serves as the introduction to this special issue of Biodiversity and Conservation on various aspects of forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

We found good statistical agreement between key structural vegetation parameters, such as mean and maximum vegetation height, with PPC metrics successfully predicting most height and tree-diameter metrics using multivariate linear regression. However, PPC metrics were not as useful for estimating ground-measured vegetation cover. We believe that part of the issue lies in the mismatch between PPC- and ground-based measurement approaches, including subjective judgement on behalf of ground crews: a topic that requires more investigation. Our work highlights the emerging value of UAV-based PPCs to complement, and in some cases supplement, traditional ground-based sources of measured vegetation structure.},

abstract = {In this study, we automate tree species classification and mapping using field-based training data, high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery, and a convolutional neural network classifier (CNN). We tested our methods by identifying seven dominant trees species as well as dead standing trees in a mixed-conifer forest in the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, CA (USA) using training, validation, and testing datasets composed of spatially-explicit transects and plots sampled across a single strip of imaging spectroscopy. We also used a three-band âRed-Green-Blue' pseudo true-color subset of the hyperspectral imagery strip to test the classification accuracy of a CNN model without the additional non-visible spectral data provided in the hyperspectral imagery. Our classifier is pixel-based rather than object based, although we use three-dimensional structural information from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to identify trees (points {\textgreater} 5 m above the ground) and the classifier was applied to image pixels that were thus identified as tree crowns. By training a CNN classifier using field data and hyperspectral imagery, we were able to accurately identify tree species and predict their distribution, as well as the distribution of tree mortality, across the landscape. Using a window size of 15 pixels and eight hidden convolutional layers, a CNN model classified the correct species of 713 individual trees from hyperspectral imagery with an average F-score of 0.87 and F-scores ranging from 0.67â0.95 depending on species. The CNN classification model performance increased from a combined F-score of 0.64 for the Red-Green-Blue model to a combined F-score of 0.87 for the hyperspectral model. The hyperspectral CNN model captures the species composition changes across {\~{}}700 meters (1935 to 2630 m) of elevation from a lower-elevation mixed oak conifer forest to a higher-elevation fir-dominated coniferous forest. High resolution tree species maps can support forest ecosystem monitoring and management, and identifying dead trees aids landscape assessment of forest mortality resulting from drought, insects and pathogens. We publicly provide our code to apply deep learning classifiers to tree species identification from geospatial imagery and field training data.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of regional to global scale vegetation dynamics (phenology) are required to improve models and understanding of inter-annual variability in terrestrial ecosystem carbon exchange and climate-biosphere interactions. Since the mid-1980s, satellite data have been used to study these processes. In this paper, a new methodology to monitor global vegetation phenology from time series of satellite data is presented. The method uses series of piecewise logistic functions, which are fit to remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) data, to represent intra-annual vegetation dynamics. Using this approach, transition dates for vegetation activity within annual time series of VI data can be determined from satellite data. The method allows vegetation dynamics to be monitored at large scales in a fashion that it is ecologically meaningful and does not require pre-smoothing of data or the use of user-defined thresholds. Preliminary results based on an annual time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the northeastern United States demonstrate that the method is able to monitor vegetation phenology with good success. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

This study used remote sensing-based NDVI time-series data from 1999 to 2007 to create the phenological curves and maps for every season and each phenological parameter was created using TIMESAT program. It was observed that evergreen forest sites are always followed by deciduous forest sites in all phenological events. The season starts by August and ends by June the following year in evergreen forests. In deciduous forests, the season starts by May and ends by March the following year. Evergreen forests have longer season than deciduous forests. Maximum temperature and rainfall have negative (r = -0.785) and positive (r = 0.502) correlation respectively with start of the season. However, maximum temperature has high positive correlation (r = 0.942) with leaf senescence. This article indicates that more studies on the phenology of natural vegetation will help to understand the responses of plants towards the changes in the climatic condition.},

abstract = {Forest phenology is a multi-scale phenomenon, arising from processes in leaves and trees, with effects on the ecology of plant communities and landscapes. Because phenology controls carbon and water cycles, which are commonly observed at the ecosystem scale (e.g. eddy flux measurements), it is important to characterize the relation between phenophase transition events at different spatial scales. We use aerial photography recorded from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to observe plant phenology over a large area (5.4 ha) and across diverse communities, with spatial and temporal resolution at the scale of individual tree crowns and their phenophase transition events (10 m spatial resolution, â¼5 day temporal resolution in spring, weekly in autumn). We validate UAV-derived phenophase transition dates through comparison with direct observations of tree phenology, PhenoCam image analysis, and satellite remote sensing. We then examine the biological correlates of spatial variance in phenology using a detailed species inventory and land cover classification. Our results show that species distribution is the dominant factor in spatial variability of ecosystem phenology. We also explore statistical relations governing the scaling of phenology from an organismic scale (10 m) to forested landscapes (1 km) by analyzing UAV photography alongside Landsat and MODIS data. From this analysis we find that spatial standard deviation in transition dates decreases linearly with the logarithm of increasing pixel size. We also find that fine-scale phenology aggregates to a coarser scale as the median and not the mean date in autumn, indicating coarser scale phenology is less sensitive to the tails of the distribution of sub-pixel transitions in the study area. Our study is the first to observe forest phenology in a spatially comprehensive, whole-ecosystem way, yet with fine enough spatial resolution to describe organism-level correlates and scaling phenomena.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing is a rapidly evolving technology. Novel sensors and methods are entering the market, offering completely new possibilities to carry out remote sensing tasks. Three-dimensional (3D) hyperspectral remote sensing is a novel and powerful technology that has recently become available to small UAVs. This study investigated the performance of UAV-based photogrammetry and hyperspectral imaging in individual tree detection and tree species classification in boreal forests. Eleven test sites with 4151 reference trees representing various tree species and developmental stages were collected in June 2014 using a UAV remote sensing system equipped with a frame format hyperspectral camera and an RGB camera in highly variable weather conditions. Dense point clouds were measured photogrammetrically by automatic image matching using high resolution RGB images with a 5 cm point interval. Spectral features were obtained from the hyperspectral image blocks, the large radiometric variation of which was compensated for by using a novel approach based on radiometric block adjustment with the support of in-flight irradiance observations. Spectral and 3D point cloud features were used in the classification experiment with various classifiers. The best results were obtained with Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) which both gave 95{\%} overall accuracies and an F-score of 0.93. Accuracy of individual tree identification from the photogrammetric point clouds varied between 40{\%} and 95{\%}, depending on the characteristics of the area. Challenges in reference measurements might also have reduced these numbers. Results were promising, indicating that hyperspectral 3D remote sensing was operational from a UAV platform even in very difficult conditions. These novel methods are expected to provide a powerful tool for automating various environmental close-range remote sensing tasks in the very near future.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Remote-sensing phenology detection can compensate for deficiencies in field observations and has the advantage of capturing the continuous expression of phenology on a large scale. However, there is some variability in the results of remote-sensing phenology detection derived from different vegetation parameters in satellite time-series data. Since the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the leaf area index (LAI) are  the most widely used vegetation parameters for remote-sensing phenology extraction, this paper aims to assess the differences in phenological information extracted from EVI and LAI time series and to explore whether either index performs well for all vegetation types on a large scale. To this end, a GLASS (Global Land Surface Satellite Product)-LAI-based phenology product (GLP) was generated using the same algorithm as the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)-EVI phenology product (MLCD) over China from 2001 to 2012. The two phenology products were compared in China for different vegetation types and evaluated using ground observations. The results show that the ratio of missing data is 8.3{\%} for the GLP, which is less than the 22.8{\%} for the MLCD. The differences between the GLP and the MLCD become stronger as the latitude decreases, which also vary among different vegetation types. The start of the growing season (SOS) of the GLP is earlier than that of the MLCD in most vegetation types, and the end of the growing season (EOS) of the GLP is generally later than that of the MLCD. Based on ground observations, it can be suggested that the GLP performs better than the MLCD in evergreen needleleaved forests and croplands, while the MLCD performs better than the GLP in shrublands and grasslands.},

abstract = {Validation over heterogeneous areas is critical to ensuring the quality of remote sensing products. This paper focuses on the sampling methods used to validate the coarse-resolution fractional vegetation cover (FVC) product in the Heihe River Basin, where the patterns of spatial variations in and between land cover types vary significantly in the different growth stages of vegetation. A sampling method, called the mean of surface with non-homogeneity (MSN) method, and three other sampling methods are examined with real-world data obtained in 2012. A series of 15-m-resolution fractional vegetation cover reference maps were generated using the regressions of field-measured and satellite data. The sampling methods were tested using the 15-m-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land cover maps over a complete period of vegetation growth. Two scenes were selected to represent the situations in which sampling locations were sparsely and densely distributed. The results show that the FVCs estimated using the MSN method have errors of approximately less than 0.03 in the two selected scenes. The validation accuracy of the sampling methods varies with variations in the stratified non-homogeneity in the different growing stages of the vegetation. The MSN method, which considers both heterogeneity and autocorrelations between strata, is recommended for use in the determination of samplings prior to the design of an experimental campaign. In addition, the slight scaling bias caused by the non-linear relationship between NDVI and FVC samples is discussed. The positive or negative trend of the biases predicted using a Taylor expansion is found to be consistent with that of the real biases.},

Plant phenology is a sensitive indicator of the effects of global change on terrestrial ecosystems and controls the timing of key ecosystem functions including photosynthesis and transpiration. Aerial drone imagery and photogrammetric techniques promise to advance the study of phenology by enabling the creation of distortion-free orthomosaics of plant canopies at the landscape scale, but with branch-level image resolution. The main goal of this study is to determine the leaf life cycle events corresponding to phenological metrics derived from automated analyses based on color indices calculated from drone imagery. For an oak-dominated, temperate deciduous forest in the northeastern USA, we find that plant area index (PAI) correlates with a canopy greenness index during spring green-up, and a canopy redness index during autumn senescence. Additionally, greenness and redness metrics are significantly correlated with the timing of budburst and leaf expansion on individual trees in spring. However, we note that the specific color index for individual trees must be carefully chosen if new foliage in spring appears red, rather than greenâwhich we observed for some oak trees. In autumn, both decreasing greenness and increasing redness correlate with leaf senescence. Maximum redness indicates the beginning of leaf fall, and the progression of leaf fall correlates with decreasing redness. We also find that cooler air temperature microclimates near a forest edge bordering a wetland advance the onset of senescence. These results demonstrate the use of drones for characterizing the organismic-level variability of phenology in a forested landscape and advance our understanding of which phenophase transitions correspond to color-based metrics derived from digital image analysis.},

The results showed the relationships betweenGRVI values and the seasonal change of vegetation and ground surface with high temporal resolution. We found that GRVI has the following advantages as a phenological indicator: (1) GRVI = 0 can be a site-independent single threshold for detection of the early phase of leaf green-up and the middle phase of autumn coloring, and (2) GRVI can show a distinct response to subtle disturbance and the difference of ecosystem types.},
